# odin-calculator
Final project of the foundations series from TheOdinProject

Combines everything Iâ€™ve learned so far: I'm going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

#### Self-reflection

*A project I did not enjoy that much, because a calculator is such a common tool. Still a good lesson to practise some of the learned skills. Gonna review this again some day, to code an awesome css styling. For now I want to proceed with TheOdinProject.*
